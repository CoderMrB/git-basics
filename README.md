//This is a 3rd branch created by Chris Branson as practice of creating and switching between branches

## Bonus Tasks

Once you're finished with your play, keep exploring and practicing with Git together.

- Try creating a separate [branch](git) each. Create your branch locally first, and then push your branches to the remote repository.
- Try co-authoring commits using [this tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/committing-changes-to-your-project/creating-and-editing-commits/creating-a-commit-with-multiple-authors).
- Explore the [git FAQ](http://gitfaq.org/) and try out the commands - treat this repo as a "soft play" area and experiment!
